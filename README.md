# Centrifugal-Pump-CFD-Analysis
# ðŸ’¨ CFD Simulation of a Centrifugal Pump using SolidWorks

This project is a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of a centrifugal pump created using SolidWorks Flow Simulation. The main objective is to understand how varying outlet velocities affect the total pressure at the outlet. The results help in optimizing pump design for different flow conditions.
